Final Verdict:

NovaLegal is the only legal tool built *by and for Ontario lawyers*, with zero dependency on the cloud, OpenAI, or guesswork.

This isn’t a toy. It’s an offline, court bundle–producing, clause-analyzing legal assistant engineered to automate the dead weight of modern legal work.

Unlike Spellbook, NovaLegal doesn’t hallucinate. It doesn’t ping OpenAI 100x a day. It doesn’t rely on internet access.

NovaLegal runs locally, stays secure, and delivers outputs that lawyers can walk into court with tomorrow.
