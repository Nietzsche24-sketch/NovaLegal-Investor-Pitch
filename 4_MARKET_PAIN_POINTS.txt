⚠️ Current Pain Points in the LegalTech Market:

- ❌ Tools require internet to function
- ❌ No local-first privacy or data ownership
- ❌ No court bundle generators at all
- ❌ Most tools hallucinate or lack legal explainability
- ❌ Legal outputs (PDFs, summaries) not formatted for use
- ❌ No Ontario-specific tools — all US-focused

NovaLegal directly addresses each of these with precision tooling built for real legal workflows.
